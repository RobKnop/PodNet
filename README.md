# PodNet
##Podcast Network
by Andrew Zhang, Robert Knop <br />
working in a class group project @ CSULB

###Objectives
PodNet is a social network, where user can upload own podcast to share them with their followers. Uploading own podcasts is optional.
The network bases like Twitter on the "Follower Principle". User can recommend podcast series, podcast episodes by creating posts. A post includes the actual podcast file and comment. Every follower receives this post in his newsfeed and can immediately start listening to the recommended podcast episode.<br />
The problem, which the current podcast community has, is that the users consume it in podcast catcher, which is providing a list based structure. Podcast listener only listens to a self subscribed podcast list. <br />
If you wish to share the podcast, you have to post the link in your social network. This post may receive your desired target audience in a mixed newsfeed with post from other friends, pictures and news. Friends who are not interested in podcasts also may see your post.
PodNet gives their users a place to share their podcasts with their desired audience with 100% guaranteed organic reach. There are not any mix-ups with non-podcast related content. The newsfeed makes it easier to explore new podcasts, because every post is a recommendation of a friend. Thatâ€™s why you can expect a certain quality.<br />

Technical Implementation:<br />
To deliver a reasonable performance with scalability in PodNet is powered by an Express.Js server with a MongoDB NoSQL database as the backend. Clients are Android and iOS smart phones running the social network application, which is developed with the Ionic framework. In this client-server architecture, the clients use the RESTful API provided by the Express.Js application. The documentation of the RESTful API is located in this Readme.md. <br />
